## 🎓 _About Me_

🏫 I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the 
<a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> 
at the 
<a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>, 
where I am advised by 
<a href="https://jundongli.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Jundong Li</a>. 
Before joining UVA, I earned my B.E. in 
<a href="https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Electronic Engineering</a> 
from 
<a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Tsinghua University</a> 
in 2020, where my diploma thesis was advised by 
<a href="https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1064/1273.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Ji Wu</a>.


📝 My research focuses on **Generalizable Machine Learning (GML)** and its applications in **trustworthy AI solutions**. My work spans diverse data modalities, including **graphs**, **knowledge bases**, and **text**, with the aim of ensuring fairness, interpretability, and efficiency in AI systems.



🤝 **Looking for collaborations to work on impactful projects!**

💼 **<span style="color: red;"> I am actively seeking faculty positions! I would greatly appreciate it if you share any opportunities. Thank you!</span>**

## 🔍 _Research Interests_

My research aims to tackle real-world challenges in **Generalizable Machine Learning (GML)** and **Trustworthy AI**, focusing on the following:

- **Generalization with Minimal Labeled Data**: Designing frameworks for few-shot learning, meta-learning, and task-adaptive model generalization.
- **Robust Learning with Noisy and Unlabeled Data**: Leveraging weak supervision to enhance model robustness across tasks.
- **Fairness and Interpretability in AI**: Developing fairness-aware GML frameworks and interpretable AI methods for socially impactful applications.
